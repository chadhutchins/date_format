What up foo?

This is a simple ExpressionEngine plugin to convert a string to a formatted date using the native PHP date and strtotime methods

Installation:

To install this massive project in ExpressionEngine, create a folder name "date_format" in your system/expressionengine/third_party/ directory named date_format and put the pi.date_format.php file in the folder. That's all.

Usage:

Say you have a channel field named {the_date} that is a string representing a date, simply do the following to format it as a proper date:

{exp:date_format date="{the_date}" format="M d, Y"}
